# :fire: Project Overview

## Brief

> Build an app that can create a hex code generator that changes the background colour to match the new hex code. 

Part of the project was to test my skills of For Loops, as it was something I was struggling to learn. After the project, I was able to gain more knowledge around for loops. Also, during the project I learnt a new appreciation for the use of certain functions like Math.floor and Math.random.
